# CS 245 (Fall, 2018) Practice Assignment 04

See assignment details on Canvas.

Insertion sort, Bubble sort, and Selection sort were all added to the repository.
As you would expect, Bubble sort was the most inefficient, and by a large margin. Selection sort was the a lot more efficient than Bubble sort. However, Insertion sort was the fastest and most efficient sorting algorithm of the three. This can be seen in the graph.

Although each algorithm has the same running time, namely O(n^2),
they still differ in efficiencies. Though wall clock time is not a very good way of measuring run time, 
we can still see determine if one algorithm is more efficient than the other.
